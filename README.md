Shows the current weather in Cupertino and Redmond. I know, exciting :)

## some comments
- openweathermap.com's free plan only allows history data for one day (see http://openweathermap.org/price), so I poll for the last 7 hours.
- I use owfont (http://websygen.github.io/owfont/) for the nice icon sets, but unfortunately the api always returns code 200 for any weather.
